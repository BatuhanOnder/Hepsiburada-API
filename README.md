# Hepsiburada-API

In this study, I used the Hepsiburada API. It is a software used for various integrations. I used the Hepsiburada API document as a source. If you want more information, I suggest you take a look at the [document](https://developers.hepsiburada.com/?docs=dokuman/baslangic).

## Installation

Download this project and open the sln file.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BatuhanOnder/Hepsiburada-API
```

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
